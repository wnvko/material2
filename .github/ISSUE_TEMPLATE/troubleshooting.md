<!--------

The Angular team can't provide general troubleshooting help. However, the extended community of
users can provide more help: 

StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular-material2
Gitter: https://gitter.im/angular/material2
Google Groups: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/angular-material2

Issues should capture only bug reports and feature requests. However, we understand that 
it is not always clear whether an issue is caused by a bug or incorrect usage of a feature/component.

Most support requests will be automatically closed. If the answer is quickly obvious, though, we 
might be able to provide a brief answer.
