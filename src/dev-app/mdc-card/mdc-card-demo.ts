              Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
              While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
              As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
              “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
              Only this and nothing more.”`;
